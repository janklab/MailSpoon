# .gitignore for Matlab projects

# Note that the various binary MEX file formats are NOT included in this .gitignore.
# That is because, unlike with most programming languages, the built binary MEX files
# should be checked into the source tree so your code can still run straight from the
# repo without a build step; they are not just distribution artifacts.

# Do NOT check the Matlab Toolbox .prj file in to the repo! This file can *not* be
# shared between multiple users, because Matlab bakes full, absolute file paths
# in to it.
